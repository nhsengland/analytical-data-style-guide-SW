# Icons & Logos

## NHS Logo

The NHS logo should always be used with the background colour as NHS blue. For dashboards that use the web wrapper or are viewed directly on server the logo is to be located in the top right hand corner of the page. The logo is included within the templates at the correct size, placement and margins. Details of these are below.

**Dimensions:**

- Height: 40px

- Width: 100px

- Margin of 32px (this should be handled by the page margins as implemented in the templates, see below)

## Icons

Icons should be used minimally and be clear and concise. They should be easily understood at a 25 x 25 pixel square size (the exception to this is the download button). 

Blue is used to indicate the icon is 'interactive' i.e there is a hoverable or clickable element to the icon.

A set of NHS England specific dashboard icons have been created and adapted from the official NHS England icon pack. These should cover most of your dashboard needs. If you require an additional icon please contact [England.AnalyticsProductsTeam@nhs.net](mailto:england.analyticsproductsteam@nhs.net).
