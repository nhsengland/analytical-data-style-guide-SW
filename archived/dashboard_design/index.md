# Dashboard design

We convey our visual identity through the products we build. Design guidelines help us to work together on sophisticated digital products, using a standardised visual language. 

The NHS Identity is one of the most recognised and cherished brands in the world. It evokes trust and reassurance.

> Branding is the art of becoming knowable, likeable, and trustable.

A style guide helps us to ensure a continuous brand experience for our users. When style is applied consistently across NHS products, it fosters loyalty and trust across all user touch-points.

These guidelines are for developers, product owners and quality assurance testers working on data visualisation products in the NHS.

## Dashboard purpose

You should think about the following questions before designing a dashboard:

<div class="glightbox-desc custom-desc1">
Questions to consider before designing a dashboard
</div>

If a dashboard is right for your project, consider it from the users perspective. Who are they? Could they benefit from a detailed report or one easy to read page? Think about the questions that each page will be answering and who would be asking the question.
