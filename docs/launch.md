# Data Visualisation Style Guide – South West

The NHS England South West **Insights & Intelligence (I&I) Team** is proud to introduce the first release of the **Analytical Product Design Guide**.

This internal guide has been developed to support consistent, clear, and user-centred design across a wide range of analytical products — including dashboards, reports, and tools built in **Power BI**, **Excel**, and **R Markdown**.

It sets out foundational design principles and practical guidance tailored to the tools and workflows commonly used within the team. By aligning our approaches, we aim to improve the quality, usability, and impact of analytical outputs across the South West region.
