## Design for Clarity and Speed

**Put the user first:**  
When designing analytical products, always consider the **end user’s journey** — their likely questions, context, and decision-making needs. A good product helps users get to the right insight quickly, with minimal effort.

## Key Design Considerations

- **Minimise Clicks:**  
  Avoid unnecessary layers or navigation steps. Users should access key metrics and context in as few clicks as possible.

- **Anticipate Follow-Up Questions:**  
  Think ahead: what is the user likely to ask next? Build in supporting metrics, tooltips, or drill-throughs that reduce the need to open another product or request more data.

- **Highlight What Matters:**  
  Draw attention to changes, outliers, or risks. Use visual cues (e.g. colour, trends, icons) to help users interpret meaning at a glance.

- **Be Consistent:**  
  Use standard layouts, naming, and filters across products so users can orient themselves quickly — even in unfamiliar content.

- **Show Your Working:**  
  Where calculations or logic are used, include links to definitions or DAX summaries in tooltips or supporting documentation.

> Every additional click, scroll, or unexplained metric adds friction. Remove as much as possible.

**Summary:**  
Design isn’t just about how a dashboard looks — it’s about how well it helps people answer questions and make decisions. Build with clarity, speed, and purpose.
