**Put the user first:** When designing analytical products, always consider the **end user’s journey** — their likely questions, context, and decision-making needs. A good product helps users get to the right insight quickly, with minimal effort.

## Key Design Considerations

**Minimise Clicks:** Avoid unnecessary layers or navigation steps. Users should access key metrics and context in as few clicks as possible.

**Anticipate Follow-Up Questions:** Think ahead: what is the user likely to ask next? Build in supporting metrics, tooltips, or drill-throughs that reduce the need to open another product or request more data.

**Highlight What Matters:** Draw attention to changes, outliers, or risks. Use visual cues (e.g. colour, trends, icons) to help users interpret meaning at a glance.

**Be Consistent:** Use standard layouts, naming, and filters across products so users can orient themselves quickly — even in unfamiliar content.

**Show Your Working:** Where calculations or logic are used, include links to definitions or DAX summaries in tooltips or supporting documentation.

Every additional click, scroll, or unexplained metric adds friction. Remove as much as possible.
