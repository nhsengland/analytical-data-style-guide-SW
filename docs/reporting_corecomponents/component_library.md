# Component Library

The Component Library is a central resource of templated, reusable assets designed to **streamline development** and **promote consistency** across analytical products.

## Re-usable Components
 
**Creating a library of pre-designed and pre-built components minimises redundant work and ensures a consistent user experience. This section details the types of components that should be standardised for re-use across our reports and dashboards.**

**Tableau Dashboard Templates:** Developed in collaboration with the [Data Viz Community of Practice](https://nhsengland.github.io/data-viz-community-of-practice/), these templates incorporate standard layouts and interactivity principles aligned with NHS accessibility and branding guidance.


**Excel Templates:** To support consistency in analytical workflows. These will cover common use cases â€” all designed with formatting, usability, and design consistancy in mind. *In development with I&I team*


**Power BI Templates:** Power BI templates will include a suite of reusable visual styles, pre-set themes, and layout structures. These will incorporate best practice for navigation, responsiveness, and colour accessibility. *In development with I&I team*


These components serve as starting points for teams to build high-quality, accessible, and user-friendly outputs, while reducing duplication of effort and ensuring adherence to NHS branding and accessibility standards.


The Component Library will grow over time as new needs are identified and templates are tested and refined in practice.
