# Component Library

A well-defined component library is a cornerstone of **efficient and consistent** data product development. By providing a collection of standardised, re-usable building blocks, we can **accelerate development, ensure visual harmony across all outputs, and maintain a high level of quality**.

## Re-usable Components
 
**Creating a library of pre-designed and pre-built components minimises redundant work and ensures a consistent user experience. This section details the types of components that should be standardised for re-use across our reports and dashboards.**


**Standardised Elements:** Maintain a library of standardised, re-usable components such as charts, tables, filters, cards, and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) displays

**Design Specifications:** Each component should have clear design specifications outlining its appearance, behaviour, and usage guidelines

## Variants
 
**To cater to diverse user needs and application contexts, components often require different visual or functional variations. This section addresses the definition of these variants, ensuring flexibility without compromising consistency.**

**Theming:** Define variants for components, such as light and dark modes, to cater to different user preferences or environmental lighting conditions

**Density:** Include compact and expanded views for components like tables, allowing users to adjust information density based on their analytical needs or screen real estate

## Code References (if applicable)
 
**For development teams, providing direct code references for our design components is invaluable. This bridges the gap between design and implementation, ensuring that the visual consistency defined in this guide is accurately translated into working products.**

**Developer Support:** Where relevant, provide code references, snippets, or links to component libraries for developers to ensure accurate and consistent implementation of components, maintaining fidelity between design and development.
