# Branding & Visual Identity

**A cohesive visual identity is essential to building trust and recognisability. All analytical products should follow the [NHS brand guidance](https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhsidentity/identity-guidelines/colours/), adapted to the I&I South West context.**

 87% of people spontaneously recall **NHS Blue** and **White** â€” using them consistently reinforces trust and brand recognition.
