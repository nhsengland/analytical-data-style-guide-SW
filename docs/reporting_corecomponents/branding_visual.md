# Branding & Visual Identity

**A cohesive visual identity is essential to building trust and recognisability. All analytical products should follow the [NHS brand guidance](https://data-viz.nhs.uk/), adapted to the I&I South West context.**

 87% of people spontaneously recall **NHS Blue** and **White** — using them consistently reinforces trust and brand recognition.

## Typography

Follow NHS font and sizing conventions to support clarity and accessibility.

| Element | Font | Size | Colour |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Header | Arial Bold | 18px | `#212B32` |
| Chart Title | Arial Bold | 12px | `#212B32` |
| Narrative Text | Arial | 11px | `#212B32` |
| Axis Title | Arial | 10px | `#4C6272` (NHS Grey 1) |
| Axis Values | Arial | 10px | `#768692` (NHS Grey 3) |
| Legend | Arial | 10px | `#212B32` |

Use **bold** headers, maintain consistent spacing, and limit fonts to Arial only.

## Layout Principles

Follow **Z-pattern layout** — top-left → top-right → bottom-left → bottom-right — to align with natural reading flow.

-  **Logo**: Always place the NHS logo at the **top-right** of the dashboard  
  Size: `100px × 40px`
-  **Narrative**: Place to the **right** of charts wherever applicable
-  **Spacing**: Use even padding and margins to group visual elements
-  **Visual Hierarchy**: Emphasise key insights and headers through size and positioning
