## Filtering Behaviour
**Filters are essential tools for users to narrow down data and focus on what's most relevant to them. How these filters operate and are visually represented directly impacts usability. This section outlines the principles for clear and effective filtering.** 

**Application:** Define how filters are applied (e.g., immediate update upon selection, or requiring an 'apply' button for multiple changes)

**Visual Indication:** Always clearly show which filters are active to the user. This prevents confusion and ensures they understand the specific context of the data they are viewing

## Drill-downs and Navigation
 
**Users often need to move between different levels of data detail or navigate to related information. Designing intuitive drill-down paths and clear navigation reduces cognitive load and allows for a more natural flow of data exploration.**

**User Flow:** Design intuitive pathways for users to move between different levels of data detail (drill-downs) or navigate between related reports and dashboards

**Clear Signposting:** Use clear visual cues and labels to indicate interactive elements and navigation options, guiding the user effortlessly through the data
