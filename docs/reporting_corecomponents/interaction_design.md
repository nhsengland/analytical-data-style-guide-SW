# Interaction Design
Interaction design focuses on **how users engage with our data products**. Thoughtful design in this area enhances **usability, makes data exploration intuitive, and ultimately helps users discover insights more effectively**. Our goal is to create **seamless and logical experiences** for anyone interacting with our dashboards and reports.

## Design for Clarity and Speed

**Put the user first:**  
When designing analytical products, always consider the **end userâ€™s journey** â€” their likely questions, context, and decision-making needs. Aim to product a product that helps users get to the right insight quickly, with minimal effort.

### ðŸ’¡ Key Design Considerations

- **Minimise Clicks:**  
  Avoid unnecessary layers or navigation steps. Users should access key metrics and context in as few clicks as possible.

- **Anticipate Follow-Up Questions:**  
  Think ahead: what is the user likely to ask next? Build in supporting metrics, tooltips, or drill-throughs that reduce the need to open another product or request more data.

- **Highlight What Matters:**  
  Draw attention to changes, outliers, or risks. Use visual cues (e.g. colour, trends, icons) to help users interpret meaning at a glance.

- **Be Consistent:**  
  Use standard layouts, naming, and filters across products so users can orient themselves quickly â€” even in unfamiliar content.

## Filtering Behaviour
**Filters are essential tools for users to narrow down data and focus on what's most relevant to them. How these filters operate and are visually represented directly impacts usability. This section outlines the principles for clear and effective filtering.** 

**Application:** Define how filters are applied (e.g., immediate update upon selection, or requiring an 'apply' button for multiple changes)

**Visual Indication:** Always clearly show which filters are active to the user. This prevents confusion and ensures they understand the specific context of the data they are viewing

## Drill-downs and Navigation
 
**Users often need to move between different levels of data detail or navigate to related information. Designing intuitive drill-down paths and clear navigation reduces cognitive load and allows for a more natural flow of data exploration.**

**User Flow:** Design intuitive pathways for users to move between different levels of data detail (drill-downs) or navigate between related reports and dashboards

**Clear Signposting:** Use clear visual cues and labels to indicate interactive elements and navigation options, guiding the user effortlessly through the data

## Responsive Behaviour
 
**Our data products are accessed on a variety of devices, from large desktop monitors to tablets and mobile phones. Ensuring that our designs adapt gracefully to different screen sizes is crucial for accessibility and a consistent user experience, no matter the viewing environment.**

**Adaptability:** Our products should be designed to adapt gracefully to different screen sizes, including mobile devices, tablets, and varying desktop resolutions. Ensure legibility and functionality are maintained across all common viewports.
