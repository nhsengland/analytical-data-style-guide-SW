# Writing Narrative

When you're writing to describe data, your goal is to tell a **clear, compelling story**. Follow these principles to make your narratives insightful and impactful:
 
**Start with the Insight, Not the Data**
 

Always lead with the main takeaway or the most important finding. Don't bury the lead—hit your audience with the core message upfront.

*Example: "A&E activity grew by 18% last quarter, driven mainly by a spike in respiratory conditions."*
 

**Add Context**
 

Numbers alone rarely tell the full story. Show why the data matters by comparing it to a previous period, a benchmark, or a specific goal. Explain the significance of what you're presenting.

*Example: "The 18% A&E activity growth is double the quarterly average over the past two years."*
 

**Explain the Drivers**
 

Identify what's causing the trends you're observing. Is it due to a new public health campaign, seasonal variations in illness, changes in service provision, or external factors like an influenza outbreak? Pinpointing the 'why' adds crucial depth to your analysis of healthcare data.

*Example: "The 15% increase in GP appointments for mental health concerns this quarter is likely due to the new 'Talk to Us' awareness campaign and increased community outreach."*
 

**Use Clear, Concise Language**
 

Avoid jargon or overly technical terms unless your audience specifically expects them. Keep your sentences short, punchy, and to the point.

*Instead of: "Q3 activity exhibited a statistically significant uptick of 6.8%..."*

*Try: "Activity increased by 6.8%—the biggest jump this year."*
 

**Anchor With Key Data Points**
 

Support your narrative with just a few key metrics—ideally 1–3. Don't overwhelm your audience with too many numbers; select the most impactful ones that reinforce your story.
