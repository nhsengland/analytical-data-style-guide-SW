# Writing Narrative

When you're writing to describe data, your goal is to tell a **clear, compelling story**. Follow these principles to make your narratives insightful and impactful:
 
**Start with the Insight, Not the Data**
 

Always lead with the main takeaway or the most important finding. Don't bury the lead—hit your audience with the core message upfront.

*Example: "A&E activity grew by 18% last quarter, driven mainly by a spike in respiratory conditions."*
 
**Add Context**
 

Numbers alone rarely tell the full story. Show why the data matters by comparing it to a previous period, a benchmark, or a specific goal. Explain the significance of what you're presenting.

*Example: "The 18% A&E activity growth is double the quarterly average over the past two years."*
 
**Explain the Drivers**
 

Identify what's causing the trends you're observing. Is it a new campaign, a shift in behavior, or external factors? Pinpointing the 'why' adds depth to your analysis.

*Example: "Email engagement rose 45%, likely due to the new personalization strategy."*
 
**Use Clear, Concise Language**
 

Avoid jargon or overly technical terms unless your audience specifically expects them. Keep your sentences short, punchy, and to the point.

*Instead of: "Q3 activity exhibited a statistically significant uptick of 6.8%..."*

*Try: "Activity increased by 6.8%—the biggest jump this year."*
 
**Anchor With Key Data Points**
 
 
Support your narrative with just a few key metrics—ideally 1–3. Don't overwhelm your audience with too many numbers; select the most impactful ones that reinforce your story.
