# Utilisation Review

To ensure continued **relevance, efficiency, and alignment** with NHS standards, all analytical products are subject to a utilisation review **every six months**. This regular review process helps identify opportunities for improvement, deprecation, or wider adoption across the organisation.

Each product must have a clearly defined Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). These SOPs outline how the product is used, maintained, and evaluated, and are listed in the [Product Catalogue](https://nhs.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/InsightsIntelligenceteam/Shared%20Documents/01%20-%20Analysis/10%20-%20Data%20%26%20Infrastructure/04%20-%20Reporting%20%26%20Publications/01%20-%20Product%20Catalogue?csf=1&web=1&e=cAb0pp) for transparency and accessibility.

By embedding utilisation reviews into the product lifecycle, we **maintain a high standard of quality**.
