---

### Data Quality/Submission Compliance

If the product uses SitRep or submission-based data, it should include or link to a submission compliance or data quality report. This promotes transparency in interpretation

### Product Navigation

All routine analytical products should be made available on the [NHS Futures page](https://future.nhs.uk/connect.ti/SouthWestAnalytics/view?objectID=1125188) under the relevant I&I programme area. They should also be recorded within the [Product A–Z](https://future.nhs.uk/connect.ti/SouthWestAnalytics/view?objectID=1125188) on NHS.

**Product Description:** Every product should include a clear description outlining its purpose and the frequency of updates on the NHS Futures product page


(*As per example shown below*)
