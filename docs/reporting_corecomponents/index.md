# Core Components of Any Reporting Product

Regardless of the platform or tool used, all analytical products should include the following core components to ensure clarity, transparency, and usability:

## Specification & Ownership

Every analytical product must have two key foundations in place before, during, and after development:

**A Product Specification:** This is a clear, accessible document that outlines the product’s purpose, intended audience, key metrics, data sources, update frequency, and alignment with design principles. It serves as a single source of truth for what the product does, how it works, and who it’s for.

**A Named Owner:** Each product must have an individual or team responsible for the product’s ongoing relevance, accuracy, and user engagement. The owner is accountable for ensuring the specification is followed, updated as needed, and that the product is maintained over time.

These foundations help avoid ambiguity, support future handovers, and align with the style guide's principles of clarity, transparency, and usability.


## Cover Page
**This section provides essential context and metadata about the product:** 

**Purpose:** What is the product designed to address or inform?

**Sharing Restrictions:** Can the product be shared outside of NHSE?

**Data Sources:** What data sources are used within the product?

**Last Refresh Date:** When was the data last updated?

**Key Contacts:** Who can be contacted for more information?

**Version Information:** What version of the product is this?

**Guidance Link:** Link to any user guide or supporting documentation

**Programme Area Linking:** Include the relevant link to each I&I product programe area

### Main Report Content
**The core content of the product, typically organised as:**

**Overview Page/Tab:** Highlights key insights or summary observations from the data

**Focused Pages/Tabs:** Provide deeper dives into specific areas or themes

---

### Metric and Metadata Descriptions

Each metric or KPI used in the product should be clearly defined and documented here (or include a link to a separate metric reference document)

---

### Data Quality/Submission Compliance

If the product uses SitRep or submission-based data, it should include or link to a submission compliance or data quality report. This promotes transparency in interpretation

---

### Coding

A link to the relevant GitHub repository where the underlying code and logic for the product are maintained

---

### Product Navigation

All routine analytical products should be made available on the [NHS Futures page](https://future.nhs.uk/connect.ti/SouthWestAnalytics/view?objectID=1125188) under the relevant I&I programme area. They should also be recorded within the [Product A–Z](https://future.nhs.uk/connect.ti/SouthWestAnalytics/view?objectID=1125188) on NHS.

**Product Description:** Every product should include a clear description outlining its purpose and the frequency of updates on the NHS Futures product page

**How to get access:** Directions on how to gain access should be clearly shown (e.g. "For access to any analytical product, please contact the I&I team at: **england.swinsightsandintelligence@nhs.net**)

(*As per example shown below*)

**Programme Area Linking:** When adding a product description, include a link from the A–Z that directs users to other products in the same programme area. Use the relevant link from the table below of programme areas.

### Access & Product Classification

**Access Control:**Each analytical product must have a defined access level based on its content sensitivity and intended audience. This ensures appropriate data governance, protects sensitive insights, and prevents unintentional sharing outside of agreed boundaries.

#### Product Classification Levels

Access levels are standardised into four categories:

**Highly Confidential**  
Access limited to named individuals or closed groups (e.g. policy, clinical or legal teams). May include patient-identifiable information or draft material not ready for broader viewing.

**NHS England – Internal (Regional Only)**  
For use within the regional NHS England team. May include performance data, internal indicators, or working dashboards still in iteration.

**NHS England – Internal (All Regions)**  
Suitable for sharing across all NHS England regional teams. These products must be well-documented, non-sensitive, and ready for broader consumption.

**NHS Region (ICBs and Providers)**  
Intended for wider access across systems — including ICBs and provider trusts. These products should meet high standards for accuracy, clarity, and contextual support.

Each product’s **classification level must be recorded in the product catalogue**, and will be used as the reference point for granting or restricting access.
